We propose a Contact Builder: an AI-driven system that compiles a detailed, verified contact profile of a person given minimal input (e.g. a name, company, or documents like resumes, business cards, PDFs). The system will first parse and extract all useful information from user-supplied documents (using OCR for images and NLP for text). It will then use this data to search a variety of public sources – such as developer sites (GitHub, Kaggle), Q&A networks (Stack Exchange), professional profiles (ORCID, Google Scholar), corporate registries (OpenCorporates, Wikidata), and social media (Twitter, Mastodon, Reddit, etc.) – via their APIs or by scraping public pages. All gathered information is fused into a unified profile or knowledge graph linking the person to roles, skills, organizations, and online activities (for example, treating the person as a node connected to skill nodes, project nodes, company nodes, etc. as in a knowledge-graph approach

). This rich profile is presented as a CRM-ready contact record, including verified contact info, career history, links to online accounts, and other metadata. The goal is maximal accuracy and trustworthiness: uncertain data will be cross-checked or omitted, and the system will flag or exclude unverified information. Throughout, we will use only publicly available data (Open-Source Intelligence, OSINT) to stay legal and ethical

Data Ingestion and Extraction
Document Parsing: The system ingests user documents (resumes, PDFs, images of business cards, presentations, contracts). We apply OCR (e.g. Tesseract) for images and NLP (tokenization, named-entity recognition) on text to extract entities like names, emails, phone numbers, companies, job titles, dates, and locations. For example, modern resume-parsing uses techniques like POS tagging and regex-based section detection to pull out skills and experience
arxiv.org
. We may leverage or train NLP models (or fine-tuned LLMs) to handle diverse formats. This yields initial metadata (e.g. “Jane Doe – Software Engineer at XYZ Corp since 2020, skills: Python, Machine Learning, ..”).
Structured Extraction: After OCR/NLP, we identify key fields (full name, contact fields, education, etc.) and build a preliminary profile. Specialized parsers or libraries (like SpaCy NER) help tag “Person”, “Organization”, “Skill”, etc. Any tabular data (e.g. in PDFs or spreadsheets) is extracted using libraries (e.g. Camelot for PDFs).
Data Cleaning: We normalize entities (e.g. standardize “C++” vs “cpp”) and filter duplicates. This stage also performs entity resolution: if multiple docs mention “J. Doe” or “J.D.”, we attempt to match them to the same individual using context (affiliations, email matches, etc.).
External Data Aggregation
Once we have core identifiers (name, company, role, web links), we query external sources:
Public Profiles & Code Sites: Check for GitHub, GitLab, Kaggle, ORCID, Google Scholar profiles. For example, GitHub API can return a user’s name, avatar, bio, repo list; Kaggle API can yield achievements; Google Scholar and ORCID APIs (or scraping) list publications. These reveal skills and interests.
Social Networks: Use APIs or scrapers for platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky, Reddit, StackExchange, Dev.to, and any that have relevant public profiles. (We will respect each platform’s terms, e.g. using official APIs or user-agent policies.) From social posts and bios, we extract interests, languages, projects, and sentiment. Research shows that public social-media posts can predict a user’s “Big Five” personality traits with reasonable accuracy (within ~11–18% error)
demenzemedicinagenerale.net
. We can leverage NLP sentiment and personality models on a person’s tweets or Reddit comments to build a character sketch: for instance, gauging traits like extraversion or openness from language and topics.
Company & Public Data: If the user provides a company or URL, we scrape the company’s “About Us” or team pages (using requests/BeautifulSoup) to confirm the person’s role. We also use OpenCorporates and Wikidata to get official company details (registration info, websites) to validate employer names. OpenCorporates API, for example, offers JSON data on companies and officers.
Academic and News: For researchers or journalists, search Google Scholar or Crossref by name to retrieve publications. For public figures, use news APIs (NewsAPI, media site RSS) to find articles. While main focus is contact info and professional profile, a journalist might value a timeline of media mentions.
Integration of Sources: All data is fused: e.g. matching a GitHub bio “Jane Doe, ML engineer” with the resume “Jane Doe – Data Scientist at XYZ” if location/company match. We create a unified knowledge graph (or database) where the person node links to nodes for each skill, past job, organization, publication, and even accounts (Twitter handle, LinkedIn URI, etc.)
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. This graph approach (like in [18]) allows relating projects, skills and sentiment: e.g. edges weighted by sentiment keywords to highlight strengths
arxiv.org
. Such a graph can later support advanced queries (e.g. “find colleagues who worked with X on project Y”).
Profile Verification and Accuracy
Cross-Checking: We compare information across sources to verify consistency. For instance, if the resume lists “Senior Engineer at ACME Corp (2020-2023)”, we check ACME’s site or LinkedIn (if available) to confirm. If sources disagree (e.g. one lists a different company), we flag or request user clarification.
Confidence Scoring: Each piece of data gets a confidence level: e.g. data from an official company registry or a verified social profile scores higher than a one-off mention on a random blog. Only high-confidence info is included in “verified” sections of the profile.
Updates & Freshness: We time-stamp data. For dynamic info (current job, latest posts) we could re-fetch on demand. Old data (an old company or defunct email) is marked as potentially outdated. We could integrate an “update monitoring” feature to notify when new data appears (like a change in employment listed on LinkedIn or a new tweet).
Ethical Checks: Crucially, we avoid forbidden data. Our crawlers skip any non-public information, any login-required content, and adhere to robots.txt where feasible. We do not guess protected traits (race, health, etc.) or engage in disallowed biometric ID (e.g. face recognition from profile pictures). We only use imagery for benign purposes (like downloading a public profile photo as an avatar) but do not run face recognition or similar identification algorithms, in line with privacy norms.
Advanced Analysis and Features
Beyond raw contact data, we can offer analytical insights:
Character & Personality: Using the collected social text, we apply sentiment analysis and personality prediction (as research indicates is feasible
demenzemedicinagenerale.net
). For example, we could infer if the person tends to post optimistically or neutrally (sentiment), or gauge traits like conscientiousness. This yields a “character sketch” summary (useful for recruiters/journalists).
Skill Endorsements & Relevance: Summarize endorsements or mentions of skills. If colleagues or posts frequently praise certain skills (“great Python dev”), highlight those. We might use NLP to extract common adjectives around the person’s name.
Network Visualization: We can show a mini-network of the person’s connections (e.g. companies, universities, co-authors). This helps visualize career path or organization hierarchy. Graph databases (Neo4j) make this feasible and interactive.
Timeline and Career Path: Present a chronology (from earliest role to latest) extracted from docs and online profiles, complete with duration. This timeline assists recruiters in understanding career progression.
Output Formats: Allow export of the profile as a vCard, CSV, or into CRMs (Salesforce, etc.). Also a concise written summary (“Professional profile”) auto-generated from the data.
Customization for Audience: The UI can toggle emphasis:
Recruiters might see an emphasis on skills, experience fit, and “likelihood to respond” (via activity level).
Journalists might get press quotes, publication lists, and signals like “frequently speaks at conferences” (gathered from event listings).
Individuals can review “My Public Profile” section to see what’s exposed and to submit corrections.
Privacy, Ethics, and Legal Compliance
Our system strictly uses public domain data. We treat web scraping as processing personal data (per GDPR), so we must be lawful and minimal. For EU users, any scraped personal info (names, job titles, etc.) is “personal data” under GDPR
iapp.org
. We therefore:
Obtain Consent When Possible: If integrating into a recruiter’s workflow, we can include a consent step (e.g. “Candidate consents to have public info aggregated”). For individuals, we might allow them to opt-in.
Principle of Data Minimization: We collect only what’s needed. For example, avoid gathering sensitive special-category data (health, religion, etc.) entirely. Delete irrelevant fields.
Transparency: The profile can include sources/links for each piece of data. We document our data sources so the user (or candidate) knows where info came from.
Security: All stored data is encrypted/secured, and access logs maintained to ensure we can audit any use of someone’s personal data.
No Harmful Actions: We do not post or distribute the data; it is only shown in the application. We comply with each site’s terms of service (e.g. Twitter’s API rules), and respect robots.txt where scraping. For example, if a site explicitly disallows crawling, we skip it.
Bias Mitigation: In analysis, we avoid stereotypes. Any AI modules (e.g. NLP or LLM summarizers) are tuned to avoid biased or inappropriate summaries. We do not infer or display protected attributes (race, health, etc.), as this is both disallowed and unethical.
These points echo best practices: “data privacy in AI recruitment is anchored on consent, transparency, and security”

, and OSINT guidelines emphasize sticking to public information and fairness

. By design, the system assists recruiters and researchers without violating privacy laws or company policies.
Key Technologies and Workflow
OCR/NLP Engine: Python with libraries like Tesseract (OCR) and spaCy or HuggingFace Transformers (NER, entity linking). Possibly use LLMs (with user-supplied docs) to extract structured data (e.g. using GPT with a resume parser prompt).
Data Harvesting: Python scripts using requests and BeautifulSoup for web pages; official APIs (GitHub, ORCID, etc.) where available. For sites without APIs (e.g. Mastodon federated instances), use public endpoints responsibly.
Database/Graph: Store aggregated data in a graph DB (Neo4j or RDF store) to represent entities and relationships. This naturally supports the “knowledge graph” profile model. The research [18][34] shows graph-based resume models; we extend this to a wider profile graph.
NLP Analysis: Sentiment analysis (e.g. HuggingFace sentiment models) and personality trait classifiers (Big 5 from text) run on collected social posts to generate metrics.
Frontend/Reporting: A web interface or dashboard (built in React or similar) where a user uploads docs and views the profile. It can feature search, filter, and export functions.
Example Features for Audiences
Recruiters: Advanced candidate search (by skill, title, location); automated candidate scoring; “strengths and gaps” report (e.g. missing certifications); email outreach templates pre-filled; ATS integration via API.
Journalists/Researchers: Chronology of career and public statements; media sentiment on the person; link to publications and patents; alerting on newsworthy events (e.g. recently wrote an op-ed).
Individuals: “My profile” report for personal branding; alerts for new mentions (privacy monitoring); suggestions to improve presence (e.g. “You haven’t linked your GitHub; add it to get better highlights”).
