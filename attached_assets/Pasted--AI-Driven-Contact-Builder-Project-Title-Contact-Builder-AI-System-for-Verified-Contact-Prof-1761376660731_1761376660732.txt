 "AI-Driven Contact Builder" Project

Title:
Contact Builder: AI System for Verified Contact Profile Generation via OSINT + NLP + Knowledge Graph Integration

Objective

Develop an AI-powered Contact Builder system that, given minimal input (e.g., name, company, or user documents like resumes, PDFs, images, business cards), automatically constructs a comprehensive, verified, and CRM-ready contact profile by aggregating, analyzing, and validating data from public online sources (OSINT).

The system must:

Ingest and extract information from user-supplied documents using OCR and NLP.

Aggregate verified, public data from APIs and websites.

Create a unified knowledge graph linking entities (person, organization, skill, etc.).

Produce a trustworthy, privacy-compliant, and ethical contact record suitable for recruiters, journalists, and individual users.

System Goals

Parse resumes, images, PDFs, and business documents for named entities (names, roles, emails, etc.).

Enrich extracted information with OSINT-based external data (GitHub, Kaggle, ORCID, OpenCorporates, Google Scholar, Reddit, Twitter, etc.).

Generate a unified structured profile (contact record + knowledge graph).

Verify, cross-check, and score confidence of all collected data.

Output the final result in human-readable (dashboard) and machine-readable (JSON/vCard/CSV) formats.

Maintain legality (GDPR compliance), transparency (data sources cited), and ethics (no private or sensitive info scraping).

Key Functional Modules
1. Data Ingestion & Parsing

Input Types: PDFs, DOCX, images (JPG/PNG), text files, business cards.

Tools:

OCR: Tesseract, EasyOCR, or Google Vision API (optional).

NLP: spaCy, transformers (Hugging Face), or fine-tuned LLM for extraction.

Tabular Data: Camelot or pdfplumber for table extraction.

Tasks:

Detect and extract: names, emails, phone numbers, organizations, job titles, skills, locations, dates.

Identify and tag entities (Person, Organization, Skill, Date, Location).

Normalize entities (standardize skill names like “C++” vs “cpp”).

Perform entity resolution across multiple docs.

Output Example:

{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "current_company": "XYZ Corp",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning"],
  "location": "San Francisco, CA"
}

2. External Data Aggregation (OSINT)

Use extracted entities (name, company, etc.) to search across open APIs and scrape public profiles:

Source Type	Example Sites	Method	Data Extracted
Developer Profiles	GitHub, Kaggle, GitLab	API	Repos, languages, activity
Academic	ORCID, Google Scholar, Crossref	API/Scraping	Publications, affiliations
Professional	OpenCorporates, Wikidata	API	Company details, officers
Social	Twitter, Reddit, Mastodon, StackOverflow	API/Scraping	Posts, bio, sentiment
Corporate	Company “About Us” pages	BeautifulSoup scraping	Job verification
News/Media	NewsAPI, RSS	API	Mentions, quotes

Respect robots.txt and platform ToS.

Store raw and cleaned data with timestamp and source URL.

Apply NLP to extract sentiment, skills, and recurring entities from posts.

3. Data Fusion and Knowledge Graph Construction

Build a Neo4j or RDF graph with relationships like:

(Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(Organization)

(Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(Skill)

(Person)-[:AUTHORED]->(Publication)

(Person)-[:MENTIONED_IN]->(NewsArticle)

Merge duplicate nodes using fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance, name similarity).

Assign confidence weights to edges based on source trustworthiness (e.g., official registry > social post).

Graph Example (Neo4j schema):

(:Person {name:"Jane Doe"})-[:WORKS_AT]->(:Organization {name:"XYZ Corp"})
(:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(:Skill {name:"Machine Learning"})
(:Person)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:Platform {name:"GitHub", url:"https://github.com/janedoe"})

4. Verification and Confidence Scoring

Cross-check consistency between sources (e.g., job title matches resume and LinkedIn).

Assign confidence scores (0–1 scale):

0.9 = official or verified API source

0.7 = consistent across 2+ independent sources

0.5 = unverified single source

Flag discrepancies or outdated data (e.g., “last seen 2019”).

Generate “Verified” and “Unverified” sections in the output profile.

5. Personality & Sentiment Analysis (Optional)

Use text (tweets, Reddit comments) to infer:

Sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative)

Big Five traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism)

Model references:

cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment

HuggingFace: personality-prediction-models

Output insights like:

“Frequently discusses open-source and machine learning”

“Language tone: highly positive and analytical”

6. Frontend & User Interface

Framework: React.js or Next.js

Features:

Upload zone (docs, PDFs, images)

Progress tracker (“Parsing Resume → Searching Public Data → Building Graph”)

Interactive graph visualization (D3.js or Neo4j Bloom)

Tabs for: Overview | Skills | Timeline | Sources | Verification

Export: JSON / CSV / vCard / PDF summary

Optional modes:

Recruiter View: Focus on experience and skill fit

Journalist View: Focus on public mentions and credibility

Personal View: Focus on privacy exposure and online presence

7. Ethical & Legal Compliance

Follow GDPR and data minimization:

Use only public, lawful, and non-sensitive data.

No biometric or facial recognition.

Provide source transparency (each field includes data origin link).

Include user consent flow if used for recruitment.

Encrypt stored data; log all data access.

No re-publishing, only internal display and export.
